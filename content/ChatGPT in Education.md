I have mixed feelings about using ChatGPT to learn something new. 

#### [Socraticly](https://chatgpt.com/share/6750b8aa-9f14-8005-8e5b-262d9a73519f):
[[Learning]] should be hard. We actively learn better when we're in the trenches of something and have to tackle it thoroughly. It's how I learned [[Calculus]]. A similar effect is achieved when we have a personal tutor challenging everything we know. In the future, [[Time Capsule|AI Tutors]] will play this role. 

#### Unfortunately, We Take the Shortest Path:
Now, with ChatGPT, when we have an error, it's much easier to copy and paste it and ask for the solution. No real learning happens here. Unfortunately, if it's available, it's what we're going to do.
