When referring to a [[Probability Distributions - PMF vs PDF vs CDF vs More|Probability Distribution]], they have unique characteristics. These characteristics can be referred to as a *Parameters*. 

### Different Parameters:
- **Mean ($μ$)**: The average value of the distribution. For a normal distribution, it determines the center of the distribution.
- **Variance ($σ²$)**: Measures the spread of the distribution; how far the values are from the mean. In a normal distribution, it determines the width of the bell curve.
- **Standard Deviation ($σ$)**: The square root of the variance, also a measure of spread.
- **Probability ($p$)**: In a binomial distribution, $p$ is the probability of success in a single trial.
- **Number of Trials ($n$)**: In a binomial distribution, $n$ is the number of independent trials.
- **Rate ($λ$)**: In a Poisson distribution, $λ$ is the average number of events in a given interval.
- **Shape Parameters ($α$, $β$, etc.)**: Some distributions, like the beta or gamma distributions, have shape parameters that determine the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution.

### Symbols for it
$\theta$ represents a generic parameter and $\hat{\theta}$ for it's estimator. E.G. $\hat{\mu}=\bar{X}$ *means "the point estimator of the population mean $\mu$ is the sample mean $\bar{X}$"*
