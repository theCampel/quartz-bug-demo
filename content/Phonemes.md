### What?
The atoms of spoken language. It's the smallest unit of sound that can distinguish meaning between two words. They're abstract categories of sound. If you group them together into triplets, you get [[Wicklephones]].

### Example:
***"bat"*** and ***"pat"*** differ by a single phoneme, which changes the meaning of the whole word.
