### What?
It's an (extremely low-level) programming language that corresponds closely to the commands of an [[ISA (Architecture)]]. As such programming language, it's human readable. The mapping from [[MIPS (Architecture)]] and MIPS Assembly Language is 1-1. What does that mean? At the end of the day, the (ISA) instructions you feed into a computer are just 1s and 0s. Assembly is a symbolic representation of MIPS which is a representation of machine instructions. 

### The Assembler:
The rest of this page is the syntax and how to code the coding language. But how do we actually ***convert*** the ***"human readable"*** (it's still fucking hard to understand) coding language *into machine code* - 1's and 0's? That's the assembler. 

### Instruction Breakdown:
***R-Type:*** `operator $destination, $source1, $source2`
	- EG: `add $t0, $t1, $t2   # $t0 = $t1 + $t2`
***I-Type:*** `operator $destination, $source, immediate`
	- EG: `addi $t0, $t1, 5    # $t0 = $t1 + 5`
***Memory Access:*** `operator $destination/source, offset($base)`
	- EG: ` lw $t0, 4($t1)      # Load word from address ($t1+4) into $t0`
	- EG: ` sw $t0, 8($t1)      # Store word from $t0 to address ($t1+8)`

### Note on `BEQ $address` works:
> [!danger] Note on how `BEQ` registers work
> When BEQ has a label, it's actually how many instructions away from the current instruction it is (i.e. 3 instructions down). To get the byte address, we [[Shifting|left shift]] it by 2 (i.e. multiply it by 4 to get its byte address from the current spot). 

### Note on how `j-type` instructions work:
Unlike BEQ, `j-type` contain the absolute address 

### [[Registers]] Conventions
- Program variables are held in \$s0-$s7
- Temporary variable es inside a method call: \$t0-$t9
- Registers \$a0-$a3 are used for passing arguments into functions.
- Register $zero is legit hardwired to 0
- There's a Program Counter (PC). This literally just keeps track of the instruction to execute for the [[CPU - Processor Components|CPU]]
- There's other special ones lol. 
- Also check [this](https://chat.openai.com/share/2090904c-2f27-4215-83fe-efc9d1b6be9f) conversation for a better idea.

### Operating on stuff > 32 bits? 
If you have a list and are reading in billions of entries, you can't store those in [[Registers]]. Instead, you store them in [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|memory]]. The way to transfer the two? Data Transfer Instructions. You can store an array's memory's address into the register. 

### Set if Less Than (SLT), Branch if EQual (BEQ):
You can use the following keywords to perform basic comparisons:
- SLE - Set if Less or Equal to
- SGT - Set if Greater Than
- SGE - Set if Greater than or Equal to
- SEQ - Set if EQual to
- SNE - Set if Not Equal to

### Assembly Example:
```Assembly
slt $t0, $s0, $s1 # Sets t0 to 1 if true, else to 0 if not.
beq $t0, $zero, l1 # If above was set to 0, jump to L1
and $s3, $s2, $s1 # Perform bitwise AND 
j l2 
l1: or $s3, $s2, $s1 # Perform bitwise OR
l2:
```

### Method Calls:
In [[Python]] or [[Java]], there's the ability to declare a function somewhere and call it somewhere else. [[MIPS (Architecture)]] does this in a roundabout way. 

We use `jal label` to Jump-And-Link to a specific label. The use of the *And-Link* bit? It sets \$ra to where you were before you left jumped. Then, whenever you want to return to wherever you were before the method call, simply run `jr ra`.

##### Convention for 'Method Calls':
The following isn't true in MIPS by default. We have to write the code so that it is. 
- Typically store *'parameters'* to \$a0 - $a3
- Typically store *'return values'* to $v0 and $v1
- Registers $s0 - $s7 *are stored* across call boundaries.
- Registers $t0 - $t9 *aren't stored* across call boundaries. 

### The Stack Within MIPS:
The[[Stack vs Heap|stack]] is a concept that's incredibly useful within MIPS. It's also fairly complicated. Read more about it in [[The Stack's Use in MIPS]]
