An extension of [[Rolle's Theorem]], it says the following:

> [!tip] Definition
> If $f$ is *continuous* over a closed interval $[a,b]$, and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$, then there exists a point $c\in (a,b)$ ([[Intermediate Value Theorem]]). The ***tangent*** to the function $f$ at this point $c$ is ***parallel*** to the *secant line connecting* $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$.
> 
> ***Simply:*** The slope from the beginning to end point is the same as at least one other tangent line to the graph.
