Similar to both [[Expected Values]] and [[Expected Values of Continuous Random Variables]]. This, by contrast, is looking at the average value of some function $g(x)$. Why is this useful? Well $g(x)$ could be $x^2$, which is a measure related to the variance of $x$.

###### Formula:
$E(g(x)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x) \cdot PDF(x)\ dx$
