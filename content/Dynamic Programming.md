### What?
Similar to [[Greedy Algorithms]], it's a methodology for solving *optimisation problems*. It involves:
- **Breaking the problem into subproblems** that (ideally) repeat several times in the larger problem.
	- Each problem is ordered from smallest to largest.
- Designing the optimal solution so that it's (ideally) **repeatedly constructed from the optimal solutions of the subproblems**.
	- The optimal solution of the subproblems can be constructed from the optimal solutions of the sub-sub-problems. (***Optimal Substructure***)
- **Storing the Subproblem solutions**: ([[Memoization ]])
