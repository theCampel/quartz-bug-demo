There's ~~2~~ many types of [[Probability]] distributions, including the PMF and PDF:

### Notation:
`X ~ Unif[a,b]` -> This is saying X is spread across a probability distribution according to the distribution *Unif*orm.

### PDF - Probability Density Function:
A probability distribution for continuous random variables.
### PMF - Probability Mass Function:
A probability distribution for discrete random variables. 
### CDF - Cumulative Distribution Function:
At a point x, it gives the probability that the variable will take a value less than or equal to x. It's non decreasing and can be thought of adding up all the probabilities until that point.

##### Calculating probability a variable falls between $x_1$ and $x_2$?
Simply do $P(x_2)-P(x_1)$.

##### Converting PDF to CDF
Integrate the PDF from $-\infty$ to the desired $x_1$. To go the other way, it's the same process but deriving with respect to that variable. 


### Different Types:
There's different types of distributions:
- [[Binomial Distribution]]
- [[Uniform Distribution]]
- [[Standard Normal Deviation]]
