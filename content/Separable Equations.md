These are [[Differential Equations|differential equations]] that, when rearranged, the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ can be arranged in the form $f(x)g(y)$. I.e:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)$$


### How to separate variables:
##### Method 1:
- Solve for the derivative and you better get something like $xy$.
##### Method 2:
1. Check for values of $y$ that make $g(y) = 0$. These correspond to constant solutions.
2. Rewrite the differential equation in the form $\frac{dy}{g(y)} = f(x)dx$.
3. Integrate both sides of the equation.
4. Solve the resulting equation for $y$, if possible!
5. If an initial condition exists, solve for the constant.
