Integration is mainly about a few things. (Note: These are all mathematically synonymous!)

It can be about being the "AntiDerivative" of a Derivative (Thanks to the [[Calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]).

Thanks to some really cool Math, it can be about calculating the *area under the function $f(x)$*. Or really, any volume as well ([[Volume by Slicing]]). This also comes with the idea of calculating the volume of a solid that was created when rotating a function (or pair of them) around the x-axis ([[Solids of Revolution]])
