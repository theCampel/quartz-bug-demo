Credit where it's due, UoE has taught me a lot.

### How To Do Well at Uni (Academically):
- [[Learning|Learn how to learn]] as soon as possible. 
	- Eg: Watching lectures *in person* is a waste of time. I absorb ~40% of information. Instead watch recordings. Take detailed notes. Ask ChatGPT for clarification on topics. Watch YouTube videos. 
- Take [[Atomic Notes]] (at least this works for me.)
	- Don't stop writing until it could explain a topic to you if you completely forget it.
- Take advantage of [[Compound Effect|compound effects]]. Pick small things to improve (eg: notetaking method, gym routine etc.). Eventually, this all compounds positively.
- Track your time. Constantly reflect where you spent most of your time. You'll find a lot of it is spent not actually productively working.
- Don't charge your phone by your bedside. Don't look at it the hour after you wake up. 
- [[Sleep]] well.
- If you can take electives in your earlier years outside of your discipline, take them. I wholeheartedly regret not taking philosophy and history lectures. The best ideas come from interdisciplinary thinkers (*Steve Jobs took calligraphy classes at Uni*). 
- Uni's going to be tough. 

### Advice if I were just entering Uni:
- Locally optimise. Don't globally optimise. 
- Do things you enjoy. Join / make spaces where you're with people who enjoy the same things. (Eg: [[EdinburghAI]])
- You make the best [[Friendships|friends]] through shared collective experiences. Go on as many trips as possible. Nights out count as ~$\frac{1}{3}$ of the equivalent time on trips. 
- Avoid like the plague people who actively drain your energy. Try and be someone who energises others. 
- [[Personal Projects|Build]] as much as you possible can, and do it in public. Join groups (or start one!) that show off these sorts of [projects](https://projectshare.comp-soc.com). 

### University Modules:
My notes are scattered across my vault (by definition of [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] lol). Some have some starting points ([[Calculus]], [[INF2C - Introduction to Computer Systems (ICS)|Computer Systems]]), but even they're incomplete. The best way is just to search and click around. 

#### Some Starting Point for Notes:
- Algorithms And Data Structures:
	- [[Greedy Approximation Algorithms]]
	- [[Time Complexity]]
- Computer Systems:
	- [[Memory Hierarchy]]
	- [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]]
- Calculus:
	- [[Calculus]]
- Computer Security:
	- [[ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)]]
	- [[RSA Algorithm]]
	- [[Buffer Overflow Attack]]
