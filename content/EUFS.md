> [!danger] What is EUFS?
> ***Edinburgh University Formula Student*** *is a **student society** that builds [[Autonomous Vehicles|self-driving]] race cars from scratch*. We then compete these race cars in the yearly competition in Silverstone, England (where they race the F1 ðŸ¤“) against teams from all over Europe. The society played a big part of life at [[University of Edinburgh|University]].

## What Do I Do at EUFS?
Currently, I'm working on using [[AI|Machine Learning]] for global path optimisation. More on that to come...

#### Previously at Formula Student:
In my first year, I was part of the ***[[Statics]]*** sub-team. When we want to Silverstone, we got awarded the best presentation they'd seen that year. We presented on:
- *The Risks of Bias in Black Box Self-Driving Models*
- *Neuro-symbolic AI as a Safety-First Learning Algorithm*
- *[[World's Readiness for SAE Level 4]]*

## What Actually *Is* Formula Student:
It's a competition in Silverstone that's split into 2 sides, ADS *(Autonomous Driving System)* and DDT *(Dynamic Driver Tasks)* -> Think self-driving and driver-yes cars respectively. ***EUFS is one of the only teams in the UK that's building a car that can be driven by people and self-drive as well** (Dubbed the ADS Car).* 

#### ADS (Driverless):
This side focuses on writing the software that allows a car (normally one that the [IMechE](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student) provides) to drive itself. Our software team is split into several parts, including [[Localisation and Mapping|localisation and mapping]], [[Planning and Control|planning and control]], [[Perception|perception]] and more. (This is essentially the [[Software for AVs|stack]] that runs on self-driving car [[Cruise|companies]]). 

For the RL path optimisation, I'm working quite closely with *planning and control* and *simulation*.
##### ADS Challenges:
To prove you'd made something somewhat decent, they put your software through the ringer with a battery of tests. Everything from driving on unseen tracks *(as fast as possible)* to essentially drag races *(measuring start-top speed-stop times)*.

#### DDT (Driver-yes):
This part builds the race-car from scratch. For a bunch of reasons, the actual building of the race-car hasn't been our strength (we've not submitted a working car while I've been at University - yet...). But there is hope.

> [!hint] Reflection
> I'm incredibly grateful I joined EUFS in 1st year. Made great friends and [[Learning|learned]] the importance of good inspirational leadership - lessons I then took to [[EdinburghAI]]. Also, got some *sick* photos. Credit to good friend [Nikita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitajegorovs/):
