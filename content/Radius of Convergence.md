### What?
With relation to all types of [[Power Series]], it's the interval around the $c$ centre of the power series that the series converges for every $x$ (i.e. accurately representing the function).

### How to get it:
Once you get $r$ using [[Converting Function to Power Series|this]], you can put $-1 \lt r \lt 1$ to solve for RoC.
