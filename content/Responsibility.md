## What:
It's the degree to which an individual or groups are accountable for their actions (or outcomes of their outcomes). 
- It's not always explicit
- It's not always a choice or a given role. 
If you come upon people on train tracks asleep, it's your responsibility to help and save them.

### It's not that clear cut though
There could be things stopping you from taking responsibility. 

### Some Interesting Thoughts:
- Who puts those responsibilities on us, and how do they decide the broad confines of it?
