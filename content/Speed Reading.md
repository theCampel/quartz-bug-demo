According to [[Tim Ferris]], there's a good way to read 300% faster:

> [!tip] Read 300% Faster
> - Read with a pen as a guide
> - For each new line, start the pen 3-4 words in. Move to the next line when you've still got 3-4 words left. 
> 
> Eventually, you'll read those skipped words in your peripheral.
