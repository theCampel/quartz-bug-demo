### Prerequisites:
$F=ma$ -> Newton's second law (*Measured in Newtons N*)
$W = mg$ -> $W$ here is *Weight* under Earth's gravity (*Measured in Newtons N*)

### Work itself:
$W = Fs$ (in Joules) where:
- $W$ is *work*
- $F$ is *Force* 
- $s$ is *displacement*

### Example 1:
Imagine a 8m chain lying on the ground, lifted to it's full length. It has a mass of 10kg per meter. Diagram below. *Solve* for the work done.

1. First find the Weight / Force of a tiny sliver of the chain -> $\Delta F = (10 \Delta y) g$ 
2. Then find the work done using the formula -> $\Delta Fy = (10g \Delta y)y$
3. We can then use integration to sum up all the tiny slivers. Remember, $\Delta y$, if small enough, can simply be called $dy$. $\therefore$ $10g \int_0^8 y \, dy = \frac{10}{2} g [y^2]_0^8 = 320g\ J$
