Some rich guy (L'Hopital) paid a poorer Mathematician (Bernoulli) so that the rule could be named after him.

The rule is straight forward:

> [!seealso] Rule
> ***If***
> $$lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{0}{0}$$ AND
> 
> ***Then***
> $$lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

This comes from the idea that derivatives contain the idea of tiny changes. If we make a tiny change around $f(x)$ or $g(x)$ (I.E. Making $f'(x)$ or $g'(x)$), we can solve those types of limits.
