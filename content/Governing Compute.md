## What:
[[High Performance Computing]] has been a key driver to the success of [[AI]]. From $2011$ `->` $2024$, compute for [[AI Training]] has increased by a *factor* of *350 million*. Governments could:
- Track compute used by a company
- Limit / subsidise compute for certain AI projects
- Enforce rules / guardrails. 

## It's Easy To Govern:
It's easy for governments to monitor how advanced AI systems are becoming because they can see the 10's of thousands of [[Data Parallelism|GPUs]] going towards these projects. How easy?
- Detectable
- Excludable: If the government wants to stop someone in particular from accessing thousands of chips, they can.
- Quantifiable: Think energy as well as chips
- Supply chain is incredibly specific / concentrated.

### But Should We?
- As [[Algorithms]] improve, the advanced models will require less compute (think Llama 2->3).
