#EUFS
(With relation to [[EUFS|EUFS]])


### What is it?:
Stands for *Autonomous Driving System*. This is mainly a [[coding]] challenge. We take a car IMECHE (the organising body gives us) and develop [[algorithms]] to make it drive *itself* around a track. Soon (soon as at 04/2023), we aim to develop our own car that can take a driver as well as drive autonomously.   ^9d1d5b

### How?:
We use mainly [[ROS]], [[C++]] and [[Python]] to do this. 

#### Subteams:
Because this is quite the complicated challenge, there's subteams.
