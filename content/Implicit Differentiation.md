> But what does that mean? Well a tiny difference in $S$ ($dS$) is equal to the above. (Note: It's dependent on the tiny differences you moved $x$ and $y$ but also $x$ and $y$ themselves).

> If you differentiate, you get there's ***no difference*** in the $S$ (I.E. $dS = 2xdx + 2ydy = 0$). 
> $\therefore$ Your value of function $S$ *won't change*. 
> $\therefore$ You can rearrange $dS$ to be the slope ***on the circle***.
