The list of all possible remainders when dividing an integer by $n$. Also known as a *"least nonnegative residue modulo"*

> [!example] Example:
> Residues modulo 5 are:
> $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$
> 
> When you divide 5 by 5, the remainder is 0.
> When you divide 6 (or 1) by 5, the remainder is 1.
> When you divide 7 (or 2) by 5, the remainder is 2.
> When you divide 8 (or 3) by 5, the remainder is 3.
> When you divide 9 (or 4) by 5, the remainder is 4.
