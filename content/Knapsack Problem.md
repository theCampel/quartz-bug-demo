### What?
> [!note] The Knapsack Problem
> *Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the **total weight** is **less than** or equal to a given **limit** and the **total value** is as **large as possible**.*
> 
> It's solvable with [[Dynamic Programming]]. 

### Details:
As the amount of options increase, the difficulty grows [[Time Complexity|exponentially]]. After each item you add to the collection (the knapsack), you have to re-evaluate which items you can now add.
