### Side Topic:
If you have $k$ selections, with replacement, from a set of $n$ distinct objects (E.G. 6 sides of a die), then the size of the [[Sample Space]] is $n^k$. So the total amount of possible outcomes for rolling a dice 3 times is $6^3$. (Technically if you get a side of the die, you replace it again for the next roll).

### Permutations: That, but without replacement. 
> [!note] Formal Definition:
> Any ordered sequence of $k$ objects taken without replacement from a set of $n$ distinct objects is called a permutation of size $k$ of the objects. The number of permutations of size $k$ that can be constructed from the $n$ objects is denoted by $_nP_k$.
>
> $$_nP_k = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+2)(n-k+1)$$ OR
> $$_nP_{k}= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$


*Note: The order of which you're dealt matters, making Permutations grow so quickly. So, in dice, a $1,4,2,5$ and a $1,2,4,5$ are different.*
