### What:
How can you ever be sure that your data (and in turn calculations) are accurate in [[Statistics]], like when calculating the [[Parameters of a Distribution]]? You can't. So you introduce a Standard Error. That is is a number (a tool really) that lets you know how sure you can be about your result. The formula is:

$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$ Where:
- $p$ is the sample proportion
- $n$ is the sample size

### Z Scores
Once you get the Standard Error, you can plug it into a normal distribution table (like the one in the Irish Formula and Tables booklet). That is then the confidence you have in your proportion's success rate / whatever you're trying to calculate.
