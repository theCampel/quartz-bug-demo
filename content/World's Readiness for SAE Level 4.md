## Explanation
A presentation analysing how ready 2 different countries in the world are for SAE Level 4. You chose Japan and Matt chose India(?)

## Speech Draft:
### Title Slide / Japan / 1:

- We will now critically evaluate different countries’ preparedness for SAE Level 4, starting with Japan
- Before asking ourselves how ready Japan is for Level 4, first consider their society makeup that puts them in a unique position. Japan, has the worlds oldest population. Left unchecked, by 2035 over a third of the population will be over 65 years old.

### Slide 2:

- With a future of less people able to drive and more people needing driven, the Japanese government recgonises a mobility crisis. And so they’re stepping in and spearheading a society ripe for AV’s.

### Slide 3-5:

- Quickly run through the legislation they’ve previously enacted.

### Slide 6:

- Fortunately for the Japanese Government, they sit atop technological and road infrastructure that can support their ambitious goals.
- Ranked as having some of the best roads in the world, Japan has spent decades developing the infrastucture that will be useful today.
- The infrastracture for the technology to be tested is already in development. Zones where SAE4 Testing is legal and allowed are being developed, with an expected 40 by 2025, 2 years away.
- There’s also a huge amount of automotive expertise. Japan’s home to Toyota, Honda and Nissan, with Honda actively testing its mapping and ajself driving tech.

### Slide 7:

- The final peice of the puzzle is determining how receptive the general public are with AV’s.
- An astounding 92% of Japanese are positive or neutral towards self driving cars.
- The benefits are also clearly well understood. 80% beleive that a reduction in car incidents is likely.
- However the story is not positive. 85% of Japanese are at least somewhat concerned with riding in an SAE Level 4 car.

### Slide 8:

- So is Japan ready? Well it’s clear that the government is trying to make it so. There’s supportive legislation and fantastic infrastructure. A supportive population that stands to gain a lot with the success of AV’s definitely helps.
- So Japan seems well on the way and is ready for SAE4, but what about a country with a more difficult path ahead? Well I’ll pass you onto Matt who can talk about… I’ve no idea

## Research on Japan:
- Japan has some of the world’s best road infrastructure, ranked among the best by the world Bank ([source](https://blogs.worldbank.org/ppps/urban-infrastructure-japan-lessons-infrastructure-quality-investment-principles)).
	 - 5th best according to [source](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/roads_quality/)
- Stats for Powerpoint on Japan ([source](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/109433/103139.pdf))
- It has a history of being progressive with AV. In 2016, they enabled free testing of AV’s on public Japanese Roads, without the need for permits or anything ([source](https://www.npa.go.jp/english/bureau/traffic/summary-guideline-en.pdf), [source](https://www.npa.go.jp/english/bureau/traffic/guideline.pdf)).
- In 2021, they were the first country to approve SAE Level 3 nationwide when the Ministry of Transport certified the tech on a Honda Legend. ([Source](https://www.iotworldtoday.com/transportation-logistics/japan-to-greenlight-self-driving-vehicles-in-2023))
- In April of 2022, the Japanese Gov’t ok’d use of SAE Level 4 vehicles on (sparsely populated?) public roads ([Sources](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7482b70a-1ade-43da-b9ed-f518ca8ba278), [Source](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2022030400318/)), the law will pass in April 2023. By 2025, there will be 40 “areas” (prefectures?) with these “mobility services”, and 100 by 2030. (Per Japanese Gov’t, [source](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2022030400318/)). - “Additionally, the ministry of economy, trade, and industry (METI) has plans for 40 autonomous taxi test sites nationwide by 2025.” ([source](https://techwireasia.com/2021/09/japans-betting-on-autonomous-cars-for-a-unique-reason/))
    - Curiously, this legislation also paves the way for Automated delivery robots on sidewalks.
- It currently has vehicles operating at SAE 4 on its public roads. In the town of Eiheiji, a  autonomous minibus transports tourists and the elderly alone it’s sparsely populated roads ([source](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/01/31/national/driverless-vehicles-fukui/)). They’re only able to do this thanks to the public research organisation AIST covering the costs and collaborating on research ([source](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/01/31/national/driverless-vehicles-fukui/)).
- The Government has laid out an official roadmap for where it wants to go ([source](https://www.npa.go.jp/english/bureau/traffic/target.pdf)).
- Home to many of the world’s leading automotive companys, for example; Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Misubushi to name a few. These companies actively perform research here to see the growing validity of the field. For example, Honda is currently testing out it’s self-driving car and mapping technology. ([source](https://aibusiness.com/verticals/honda-and-cruise-to-test-autonomous-vehicles-in-japan))
- Japan has an vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, looking to take advantage of and utlise the lax laws.
