With relation (pun lol) to functions, you can have a whole lot. 

Only [[Relations|relations]] that are injective and/or surjective are [[Functions]]. What is that you may be asking?

### Injective (One-to-one):
- A function $f : A \rightarrow B$ if every $A$ has a unique (i.e. not repeated) image in $B$. I.E. No 2 distinct elements map onto B. 
- Not all B are necessarily mapped. Some are lonely outputs waiting for an input to connect to it. 
- I.E. No "doubling up." Different inputs give different outputs.

### Surjective (Onto):
- A function $f : A \rightarrow B$ if every $B$ is mapped **onto** by at least a single element of $A$. 
- No "gaps" in the output. The entire codomain is covered.

### Bijective (One-To-One and Onto - AKA Perfectly):
- The most perfect function $f$, as it's every A perfectly mapping to every B, with no overlap and no duplicates.
- These types of functions have an inverse, $f^{-1}$. This *"undoes"* whatever $f$ did.
