> [!define] Definition
> Often referred to as *"The Instantaneous Rate of Change"*. Alternatively, consider that that's also the definition of a ***slope of a function***. Thus, the derivative also gets you the slope of a curve. Since TIROC is quite *oxymoronic* (explained below), it's more mathematically accurate to refer to it as "*The Best (constant?) Approx for a Rate of Change*".

##### Oxymoronic:
Consider the definition *The Instantaneous Rate of Change*. That's a [[Paradox]] in and of itself. How can something be ***instant*** (*at a single point in time*) and ***change*** (*a difference between two points in time*)?

Thinking of it as a slope just makes sense. The term $\frac{d(x)}{dx}$ for a function $f(x)$ is *literally* the slope formula. A tiny change in the ***rise*** (aka the $y$) over the tiny change in ***run*** (aka the $dx$). 

To go from a function to it's derivatives, there's a certain art to it. Some really smart people discovered the art and patterns and made some [[Rules of Calculus|rules]]. It's useful to know the art behind it as well.
