## The Fall Of A Single World:
***Read the essay [[The Fall Of A Single World|here]].***
#### Background:
Humanity has longed for personalisation in medicine, nutrition, education and more. In this essay, I write about the future of personalised media and what it will look like. ***Currently a work in progress** (build in public they said lol).*

## Written Prediction of 2030:
***Read the essay*** [[Time Capsule|here]].
#### Background:
I wrote this essay in just under 2 days. I'd been thinking a lot about what the future would look like with [[AI|generative AI]] and [[Virtual Reality|mixed reality]] when they'd matured. I wanted to document exactly what I thought in a verifiably dated format, so I wrote and published it to [[Github]]. You can find the original article [here]().

I look back and cringe at some of the parts of this essay. *(The visions wouldn't have microphones???)* But it's a piece I'm proud of. I love the idea of a personalised world, and want to build in that direction. 

There's also more auxiliary pieces available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/theCampel/TimeCapsule/tree/main). 

## Billion Dollar Idea:
***Read the essay*** [[Agents' Playground|here]].
#### Background:
During my internship at JP Morgan, I dove into the world of AI agents. [[AI|AI Models]] are not reliable enough today to be deployed at scale and work for their creators, but they're making progress. Assuming the actual models were smart enough, what does that unlock? What fundamentally new paradigms are available? What's the infrastructure required to bridge smart models and operating in the world? 

I brought this idea to [[Entrepreneur First]], where I got offered to be a cofounder (by one of the cohort) for this very idea. I turned it down because I wanted to finish Uni first. There'll always be another idea.
