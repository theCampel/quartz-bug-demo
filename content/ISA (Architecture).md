> [!warning] Architecture$^2$
> Wait! This page refers to ***hardware architecture***. It defines how software at the lowest level (eg [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|assembly]]). This is different from [[Operating System (OS)]], which focuses on designing an environment for applications to run, abstracted away from hardware details.

### What is it?
It stands for ***Instruction Set Architecture***, also known as the *Computer Architecture*. It's the set of instructions that a CPU can execute. It's the bridge between the software and the hardware. It's the equivalent of *Language* (Note: It's the concept / [[Technology]] of language not a specific one) to a computer. 

You can have different specific ISA's, like [[MIPS (Architecture)]], [[ARM (ISA)]] or [[x86]].  Each of these are just different sets of commands designed for different chipsets. You can have different flavours/implementations of individual Architectures (Dubbed [[Microarchitectures]]). This allows the industry to put out newer chips. As long as you preserve the ISA, the software will continue to run. 

### What can ISAs do?
- Abstracts away hardware details to programmers.
