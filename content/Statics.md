#EUFS 
### What is it:
This is a subteam of [[EUFS|EUFS]]. It's focused on analysing trends (in my time) on the self-driving landscape. You take this information and make presentations, namely:
- [[Real World Ai]]: presentations covering the real implications (positive and negative) of ML with self-driving cars. 
- [[Business Plan Presentation]]: Building a viable business product with the car that we're building
- [[World's Readiness for SAE Level 4]]


that's not so much focused on building or designing the cars or algorithms. Instead, you make presentations. The presenations differ between the DDT and [[Driverless (ADS)|ADS]] teams, but since I was more on the latter side, that's the one I'll focus on.  ^2f4667
