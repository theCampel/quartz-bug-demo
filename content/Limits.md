### Perspective Realisation:
So far, we've been interpreting limits without even realising it. The term $\frac{d}{dx}$ actually has the idea of a limit built in. As you make a tiny change thats so tiny (so tiny it may even be approaching 0 ðŸ˜‰), you can get the derivative / slope of a function.

> $$\frac{d}{dx}f(2) = lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$$
> This is nice because it avoids the paradox of "infinitely small". 

There's also an Epsilon Delta definition ðŸ˜ž.

> [!note] ED Definition
> Imagine an input range and output range. If you shrink the input range enough, then the corresponding output range should also still be able to shrink. Thus there's a defined limit.

There's also the idea of [[L'Hopital's Rule]].
