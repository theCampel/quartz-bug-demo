## What're the fundamentals?
***CIA*** is the core 3. Similar (but different) to [[CAP - Brewer's Theorem|CAP]]:
- ***Confidentiality***: Information should only be accessible to authorised entities (links to *Authenticity*). 
- ***Integrity:***
	- Data is untampered and uncorrupted
- ***Availability:***
	- Accessible when you need it. 
- **Authentication**
- ***[[Anonymity]]***
- **Unlinkability:** An attacker should not be able to deduce whether different services are delivered to the same user.
- **Non-repudiation**: The author of an action should not be able to deny doing said action.

## Security Threat Categories
- Interception
- Interruption
- Modification
- Fabrication
- Repudiation
- Epistemic

## Security Principals:
- ***Defence in Depth***: Like a castle, build multiple layers of the of security. If one fails, another acts as redundancy / reduces impacts. 
	- EG: Firewalls, intrusion detection, network segmentation, antivirus, least privilege etc.
- ***Least Privilege***: Users / programs should only have access to what's required. 
- ***[[Privilege Separation]]***: Segment the system into components which can be accessed. EG apps need distinct permissions.
- ***Open Design:*** Avoiding security through obscurity. 
- ***Economy of Mechanism:*** Keep a security mechanism simple.
- ***Fail-Safe Defaults:*** The default should be conservative. Eg New users should have least privileges.
- ***Complete Mediation:*** Every access to a resource should be checked for compliance with security policy. 

## Security Goals in Web Browsers:
- Web apps should provide the same security guarantees as normal apps.
1. `evil.com` shouldn't infect the rest of my computer
2. `evil.com` shouldn't compromise my `gmail.com` session
3. Sensitive info on `gmail.com` should be kept that way.
