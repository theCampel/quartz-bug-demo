With relation to [[Set Theory]]: It basically says that a number in set A ($a$) can be related to a number in set B ($b$) by a given relation. This is written as $aRb$, or $R\in(A\times B)$.

They can be the following:
- One-to-one
- Many-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-Many

They're mathematically (sorta?) synonymous with the idea of [[Functions]]. It's the mapping of a given input item to a given output item. 

> [!danger] Note!
> This is not ***exactly*** synonymous with functions. Relations can also include stuff like comparisons. They're functions with less strict qualifiers. Check them in the [[Functions]]
