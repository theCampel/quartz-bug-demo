> **Most Advanced Yet Acceptable**. Concept taught to me by [[Cruise]]. 
>If a company is breaking ground with an innovative technology, but society isn't ready to accept it, it won't become widely adopted. 

### Application:
Think of the iPhone. If you tried to release the iPhone 14 back in 2005, it would not have become widely adopted. You had to get them to what was the most advanced yet acceptable then and slowly ease them into it. 

The same is true for [[Autonomous Vehicles]]. If you were to give everyone a self driving car today (April 2023), most people wouldn't accept it. It would be the most advanced, but still less acceptable.
