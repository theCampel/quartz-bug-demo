### What?
When dealing with [[Exponents|exponentials]] and growth of populations, the logistic equation better represents the the population.

$$\frac{dP}{dt} = rP \left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)$$
Where: 
- $P(t)$ is population with respect to time
- $t$ is time
- $\frac{dP}{dt}$  is the instantaneous rate of change of population
- $K$ is the carrying capacity (the max population the environment is capable of sustaining)
- $r$ is the growth rate

The solution is:
$$P(t) = \frac{P_0 K e^{rt}}{(K - P_0) + P_0 e^{rt}}$$
Where:
- $P_0$ is the initial population
