### What?
When building a behemoth of a system (think YouTube, OnlyFans, Chase Bank, etc), you need to design it well. **Good Design** entails:
- **Scalability**
- **Maintainability**
- **Efficiency**
- **Reliability:** If it runs normally when everything's fine, but shit just has a meltdown the second something goes wrong, it's not really ready for operating at a global scale.

### What's involved?
When you have a system like described, you typically want to do 3 things with it. These 3 things should conform to what makes the good design as described above:
- **Move Data**
- **Store Data**
- **Transform Data**
