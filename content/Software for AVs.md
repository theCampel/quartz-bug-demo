There's a shit ton to solve.

[[SLAM]]

Ok so there's mutliple bits:
The [[Sensors for AV's|Sensors]] feed into "sophisticated software", plots a path, sends instructions to cars actuators and drives.

There's hardcoded rules of the road it must follow. These take precedent over anything else the NNs may conclude. 
- Obstacle avoidance
- Predictive Modelling
- Object Recognition (for stop signs, traffic lights etc.)

Simplified Version of how it goes:
1. User Interface Layer
	- Dashboard Display: Shows the user relevant information such as vehicle status, route planning, and traffic conditions.
	- Voice Assistant: Allows hands-free control and interaction with the vehicle systems.
2. Middleware Layer
	- API Gateway: Handles communication between the User Interface Layer and the various subsystems in the stack.
	- Data Storage: Manages storage and retrieval of data generated during vehicle operation, such as maps, sensor data, and user preferences.3. Decision Making Layer
3. [[Perception]] & Localisation Layer
	- Sensor Fusion: Combines data from multiple sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to create a comprehensive view of the vehicle's surroundings.
	- Object Detection and Tracking: Identifies and tracks objects, including other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and obstacles in the vehicle's path.
	-   *Localisation*: Estimates the vehicle's position and orientation within the environment using sensor data and map information.
4. Decision Making
	- Path Planning: Determines the best route to reach the destination using map data and real-time traffic information.
	-   Control Algorithms: Calculates acceleration, braking, and steering commands based on path planning, sensor inputs, and vehicle dynamics.
5. Actuation Layer
	- Vehicle Control Interface: Translates the control commands from the Decision Making Layer into signals for the vehicle's actuators.
	- Vehicle Actuators: Controls the vehicle's throttle, brakes, and steering systems to execute the desired maneuvers.
