How to [[Proofs|prove]] if something is a prime or a composite (made up of a few smaller things?)

### The definition you're used to, complicated:
> $n$ is prime $\iff$ $n > 1$ *and* for all positive integers $r$ and $s$, if $n=rs$ then either $r$ or $s$ is $n$.

Basically:
n is prime iff one of the factors of n is n itself (and the other is 1 obviously).

### Definition of Composite:
> $n$ is composite $\iff$ $n > 1$ *and* $n=rs$. For some integers $r$ and $s$ with $1 < r < n$ and $1 < s < n$.
