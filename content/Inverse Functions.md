> They * **reverse the operations** done by a function*. When plotted, it's the mirror of a function across the $x=y$ line. Not all functions are invertible, only one's that pass the [[(Calculus)Tests|horizontal line test]] (I.E. One-To-One). It turns $f(x)=y$ to $f^{-1}(y)=x$. 

### To Find:
To get the inverse, replace the function's x's with y's and then solve for y instead. Alternatively, if you're given a value that the $f(x)$ equals, say 22, just think really hard about about function $f'(x)$ satisfies that.
