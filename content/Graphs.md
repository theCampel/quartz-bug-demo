# Graphs in Mathematics and Computer Science

Graphs are structures consisting of **Vertices** (or nodes) and **Edges** that connect these vertices. They're used to model pairwise relations between objects.
### Key Terminology and Concepts:
- **Vertices (Nodes):** Fundamental units in a graph.
- **Edges (Links):** Connections between vertices.
- **Loop:** An edge that connects a vertex to itself.
- **Parallel Edges:** Two or more edges connecting the same pair of vertices.
- **Adjacent Edges:** Edges that share a common vertex, like $e_1$ and $e_4$ on $v_2$ (See below).
- **Incident Edges:** Edges that touch a specific vertex.
- **Graph Diameter:** The longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph.
- ***Directed Graph (Digraph):*** A graph where the edges have direction, indicating flow from one vertext to another.

### Degree of a Vertex:
- **Undirected Graph:** Number of edges incident on a vertex, denoted as $deg(v)$.
- **Directed Graph:**
    - **In-Degree:** Number of incoming edges to a vertex.
    - **Out-Degree:** Number of outgoing edges from a vertex.

### Types of Graphs:
- **Complete Graph:** A graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
- **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph, where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.
- **[[Bipartite Graph]], Planar Graph, etc.:** Various other types with specific properties.
