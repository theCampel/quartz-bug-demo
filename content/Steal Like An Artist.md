## What:
- A great book by artist Austin Kleon.
- My sister lent me it, which I then finished in less than an hour.

### Key Ideas:
- There's no new ideas. Everything that seems new, is simply a remix of other things.
- One can *copy ideas*. 
	- ***Copying*** something that someone has done. 
	- There's no creativity in this.
	- It's quite tasteless. 
	- You see it everywhere - it's even in [Mr Beast](https://youtu.be/gauf6ZmIXxs?si=0tcEb3z4tkfXfsQW) videos lol.
- One can also remix ideas tastefully. This is ***getting inspired*** by great artists. 
	- You do this by studying (many different diverse) great pieces of art and combining them in a unique way. 


> [!example] Side Note:
> I constantly felt while making my website, it was shaping too much like Steven Gong's [site](stevengong.co). I tried to add my own fresh spin, but maybe I've still got further to go to be a great artist.
