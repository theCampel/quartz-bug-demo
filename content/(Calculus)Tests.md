*Vertical Line Test* tests if a function is actually a function. How're you gonna have 2 outputs for the same input.

*Horizontal Line Test* tests if a function is [[Inverse Functions|invertible]].

### First Derivative Test:
Tests if something is a critical point. (Or just gets you the slope - whatever way of thinking you prefer.)

> [!faq] Conditions
> If $FDT = 0$ *or* $FDT=\emptyset$, then it's a critical point. 

### Second Derivative Test:
Tests if a critical point a local max or minimum.

> [!faq] Conditions
> If:
> - $f''(c)<0$, local max
> - $f''(c)>0$, local min
> - $f''(c)=0$, inconclusive
