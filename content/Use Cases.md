### What:
When talking about [[Software Engineering]], it's important to define how each part is going to be used. A use case is a ***task or unit of functionality which the system is required to support, and which has a value for at least one user***. 

### Users:
This is any system, human or not, that interacts with another system. 
### Actors:
A type of user who takes an active part in the use case. They have specific roles (each '*bank customer'*). 

### Use Case Scenarios (Instances) Example:
- *Goal / Use Case Name*: Buy a product
- *Main Success Scenario (MSS)*:
	1. Customer browses catalogue and selects items to buy 2. Customer goes to check out
	2. Customer fills in shipping info
	3. System presents full pricing info
	4. Customer fills in credit card info
	5. System authorises purchase with customer
	6. System confirms sale to customer
	7. System sends confirmation email to customer
