> [!note] Theorem
> Suppose $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$ is a [[Series]] with positive terms $a_n$. Suppose both function $f$ and positive $N$ exists such that:
> 1. $f$ is continuous
> 2. $f$ is decreasing
> 3. $f(n)=a_n$ for all $n\ge N$
> Then: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}\ \text{and}\ \int_{N}^{\infty} f(x) dx$$
> both converge or both diverge.

> **Intuition:** If you have a function that is continuous, decreasing and models the series for each term. Then if the integral converges / diverges so does the series.
