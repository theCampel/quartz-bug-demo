### What's a word?
Have you ever thought about it? It's a pairing between a *form* (sound) and a *meaning* (they're memorised). A rose doesn't exactly smell sweet or feel thorny, but we evoke that idea. It's useful when considering [[Human Nature]] but also [[Natural Language Processing]] 

### Rules of Language (Generative Grammar):
By combining the words in specific ways, we can express meanings. 

A sentence $S$ is made up of Noun Phrases $NP$ and Verb Phrases $VP$. $NP$s are made up of a determinant and noun, where $VP$s are made up of Verbs $V$ and $NP$s. These rules can scale up to googleplex amount of sentences. Occasionally, the words at the bottom (`x2` and $rose$) are both called ***terminals***. The internal nodes are called ***Non-terminals***.

***Note:*** Can also work for [[Object Orientated Programming (OOP)|programming languages]], specifically, this refers to a [[Context-Free Language]]

### Learning Language:
- Learning language occurs in bursts. Children between 3-8 hear a word once and can instantly go on using it.
