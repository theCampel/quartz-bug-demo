### What:
A receptive field describes an area on the body where a stimulus could elicit a neuronal response. E.G. The skin's surface, the frequency range of a sound, the chemical properties of an odourant.

***Note:*** Not all RF's are created equally. Fingertips have small somatosensory RFs, but your back has much larger ones.
