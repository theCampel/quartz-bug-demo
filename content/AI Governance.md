> The UK government (under Sunak) released a document on how frontier labs can be safer, as well as encouraging them to release how they're being safe at the moment. The document is [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653aabbd80884d000df71bdc/emerging-processes-frontier-ai-safety.pdf). This page is how they suggested scaling the models safely. 

## Responsible Scaling:
In order to (in the eyes of the government) be safer, a "Responsible Scaling Framework" for managing risks and deploying [[AI]] models. 

### 1. Risk Assessments:
- Assess risks at all points in time. Analyse factors like expert forecasts (guesses) and [[(Machine Learning) Models|model]] [[AI Benchmarks|evaluations]].
- Define specific thresholds that, if breached, require specific actions or mitigations. 
- Develop plans for if/when each threshold is exceeded.

### 2. Model Evaluations and Red Teaming:
- Evaluate models for dangerous capabilities, lack of control and [[Computer Security|security]] weaknesses.
- Constantly evaluate the models (at every point of [[AI Training]])

### 3. Information Sharing:
- Share general risk info:
	- Risk assessment processes, internal governances with government authorities. 
- Share model information (obviously hard to do)
- Share different information based on audience / stakeholders. 

### 4. Security Controls:
- The last thing we want is the weights getting stolen. Have good [[Computer Security||cybersecurity]] posture. 
- Do not enable the models to do something dangerous in the first place.

### 5. Reporting Structure:
- [[Incentives|Incentivise]] people to report vulnerabilities in AI models
	- Á la bug bounties. 
### 6. Identify AI-Generated Material:
- Research and implement robust [[AI Watermarking]] systems. 
- These should be hard to remove.

### 7. Prioritise Safety Research:
- Research [[Mechanistic Interpretability]], robustness etc. 
- Openly share the safety research. 

### 8. Monitor & Prevent Model Misuse:
- Detect misuse. 
- Filter harmful prompt
- Develop rapid response plans. 

### 9. Data Input Controls and Audits:
- *Responsible Data Collection...*
- Remove harmful data from training process.

> There was no call for [[Governing Compute]].
