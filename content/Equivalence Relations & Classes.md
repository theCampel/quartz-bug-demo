Heavily interconnected with the idea of [[Relations]]:
### What's it all about? Eq Relations first:
If you want to say *"Set $Q$ is an equivalence relation to Set $S$"*, it needs to satisfy 3 properties for all $a$, $b$, $c$ in $S$. 
1. **Reflexivity:** $a$ is related to itself, I.E. $a \equiv a$
2. **Symmetry:** If $a \equiv b$ then $b \equiv a$
3. **Transitivity:** If $a \equiv b$ and $b \equiv c$, then $a \equiv c$
	1. Note: There's the idea of Transitive Closure of a Relation. If you have a set that only has (a, b) and (b, c), then the transitive closure is the set with all of those previous sets as well as indirect routes, like (a, c).

### And Relations Classes?:
The idea of splitting different relations into different buckets (classes). Each bucket contains things considered the same by that rule. 
##### Quick Example:
If your equivalence relation is $aRb$, where $R$ is $3|(m-n)$, then a suitable class would be where all remainders are 1. I.E. $[a] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}\ |\ x=3k + 1\ for\ some\ k \in \mathbb{Z}\ \}$

### Equivalent Relations and Classes
When the relation is all ***reflexive***, ***symmetric*** and ***transitive***. A class is splitting different relations into different buckets, containing things considered the same by that rule. E.G If your equivalence relation is $aRb$ where $R$ is $3|(m-n)$, then a suitable class would be where all remainders are 1. I.E. $[a] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}\ |\ x=3k + 1\ for\ some\ k \in \mathbb{Z}\ \}$
