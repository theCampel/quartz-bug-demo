> Not related to the [[Stack vs Heap|stack]] when referring to [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually]]. This page's contents refer more to how you operate on a [[Lists|list]]. They're not a physical part of memory, more a level of abstraction that helps keep things efficient. 

### Stack:
Operating on a list in buffer ***Last In, First Out***. This is kinda like working on a stack of vertical poker chips. Elements are only ever added, read or removed from the *front* (top) of the list
##### Implement them?
Basically, any implementation of lists can be restricted to operate as a stack. 

### Queue:
Conversely, elements added to the back (of the queue), then the ones at the front of the queue are read / removed from the front. ***First In, First Out***.
