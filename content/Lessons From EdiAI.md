## Leading:
- ***Lofty work and autonomy motivates people:*** Remind people that they're a part of something great *(in our case, the AI society of one of the best schools in the world)* and that they can do anything *(Eg: nothing stopping us from getting DeepMind in to give a talk*).  
- ***Work visibly hard:*** This is obvious. The rest of the team should be equally invested, but if someone can't do something (non-technical obviously), the onus should fall on the leader to pick up the slack. They should know they're supported and not alone. *That said*, they should be invested to work through it even when it is hard.
- ***Give people autonomy:*** Give genuinely important (and difficult) tasks to competent people. Give them resources and motivation (through lofty [[Goals|goals]]). Don't just pawn off stuff you don't want to do. Check in frequently, but leave it as theirs. Give them credit every step of the way. 

## Team
- ***Quality of committee > Quantity of committee***. A small team of highly capable and motivated individuals will do ***far*** more work than a large team of half-assed mostly-interested people. 
- ***Corporate vs. Startup exists in Uni:*** Corporate vs Startups represents big, slow moving, lots of talk, established, reputable vs smaller, faster moving, unknown etc.. These are traits found in Uni societies as well. [[EUFS]], as great as it is, is a behemoth. They've no problem recruiting, but often recruit like corporate. Startups have the ability to only take on cracked people. As a result, they can move at breakneck speed. Both have their place in the world (and in [[University of Edinburgh|uni]] as well.)

## Organisational Stuff:
- ***Upfront Time Commitment > Aggregated Time Commitment:*** *Students prefer to give up a full Saturday and/or Sunday (combined ~24-48 hours) over 4 hours a week over 8 weeks*. Wasn't intuitive to me, the data proved otherwise. Thus easier to get people to work on a hackathon project over a longer-term project. 
- ***When hiring, send rejection letters promptly:*** Hiring is hard, cos you have to reject people who are great but not quite a fit for you. Be clear, honest and concise in your rejection. 

## Expo:
- Less lanyards
- Judge in before the public shows up. Deliberate when the public arrives. Announce winner before public leaves. 
- Make a good rubric. Don't doubly weight anything - even if you think it's important. People learn to play into that. 
- Having more knowledgeable judges is a lifesaver so they can grill contestants. 
- Having more authoritative (eg person from industry, lecturer etc.) is also a lifesaver - people value their opinion more (even without basis)
