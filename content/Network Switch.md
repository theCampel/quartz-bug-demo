## What?
It's like an old school telephone operator that directs a message from one computer in the network to another in the local network. Most household routers are both a router (to reach out to the internet) and a switch (to enable the communications within the network). The people that were doing this were smart.


## Network Hubs, by comparison?
They basically just take anything that's given to them and shout it to the rooftops. That's it... If this was a job, it's a megaphone. That's dumb by comparison. They're old. No one uses them lol.
