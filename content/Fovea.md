### What:
It's a section at the back of the eye at the centre of the retina. It's responsible for the bit of your vision that's in focus. 

### How it's different to the rest of the eye:
There's a super high concentration of cone photoreceptors (responsible for colour). At the fovea, there's a 1-1 mapping of cones to nerves. This helps with processing sharpness / detail.
