Measured in Hertz, It's a signal that goes off every few nanoseconds. The point? If for every relevant circuit you add an *and* [[Logic Gates|logic gate]], the signal will only go off when it's meant to. This causes the circuits to be very stable.

The Q will only change whenever the clock changes upward.
