### Power Rule:
Simple: $x^n$ -> $nx^{n-1}$


> [!tldr] Sum Rule:
$\frac{d}{dx}(g(x)+h(x)) = \frac{dg}{dx} + \frac{dh}{dx}$
> Think of the tiny changes in both of the individual functions

> [!tldr] Product Rule:
> $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$
> Then $\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{dg}{dx}h + \frac{dh}{dx}g$
> Think of the rectangle.

> [!tldr] Chain Rule
> If $f(x) = g(h(x))$
> Then $\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{dg(h)}{h}.\frac{dh}{dx}$
> Think of this as 3 separate number lines. The change in $h$ ($dh$) depends on the change in $x$ ($dx$). The change in $g$ ($dg$) depends on $dh$. If we differentiate starting from the outermost layer, everything falls into place.
