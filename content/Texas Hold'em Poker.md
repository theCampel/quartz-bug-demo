### What is it really though?
If it were only a game of chance, how come Bryn Kenney profited $54 million in his career? It's a mix of [[Probability]] and people skills. 

### Rules:
- ***Goal of Poker:*** Walk away from the table with more chips than you came in with
- ***Goal of each round:*** Either by every other player giving up or you or having the best hand at a showdown, you take the chips that were put into the middle of the table
### Table Position:
The position you play at in the table is very important. The person to the left of the Dealer / Button has to act immediately, without any information of what other people have. Consequently, the dealer (Button) and person to the right (CO - Cutoff) have the most information.
