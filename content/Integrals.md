#### Premise (Relates heavily to [[Riemann Sums]]):
Imagine you have a car travelling a displacement $s(t)$, where $T$ is a specific time on his journey. He *gradually* speeds up, steadies out and slows down. His velocity at any one time $t$ is $v(t) = t(8-t)$. 

A tiny change in displacement $s$ (I.E. $ds$) can be gotten using a *tiny change in time* (I.E. $dT$) *multiplied* by the velocity *at that point in time $T$*. Rearranged you get $\frac{ds}{dt} = v(T)$.

Cue the idea of [[Integration]]
