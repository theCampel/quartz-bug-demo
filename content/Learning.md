### Learning Philosophies
- ***Learn Depth Wise:*** Pick concrete projects that are firmly outside of your breadth of knowledge. Then [[Personal Projects|build ruthlessly]]. You'll learn everything you need to by constantly asking the right questions. 

- ***Feynman Technique:*** Try teach the topic to someone who doesn't know it. You'll find out pretty quickly where your gaps are. Also, you'll become a better educator / [[Public Speaking|communicator]]. 

- ***[[First Principals]]:*** Ruthlessly ask *"Why?"* to any sentence you say out loud. This is essential.

- ***Just Start:*** Don't paralyse yourself by trying to locally optimise anything, especially your learning. Just start. You're better off learning something sub-optimally then staying at the beginning *(which is technically optimal lol).* Take [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]]. 

- ***Experiment Ruthlessly, Endlessly:*** Everyone learns differently. This also ties into [[Productivity]]. Experiment with every potential variable. Track the results.
	- Try more/less hours of sleep.
	- Try caffeine / no breakfast / breakfast.
	- Try different notetaking methods. Try handwritten or digital.
	- Try learning by building. Try learning by watching lectures only. Try not watching lectures at all. 
	- I found I learn best with good sleep, trying to teaching others and spaced repetition, but you could be different. Never stop experimenting with new methods as well!

- ***Reach out to experts:*** There's literally nothing stopping you from reaching out to someone you admire on the internet and asking them questions (learn how to send a good [[Cold Email]]). 

- ***Take Care of Yourself:*** Drink lots of water. Exercise. 

- ***Snowball your efforts:*** Work on something really hard for a long period of time. Do it for long enough, and the effects will make you immeasurably better. Ties into [[Compound Effect]].
