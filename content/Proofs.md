#dmp 


### What is it?
Often a mathematical statement. It's a line of reasoning that's so convincing many people would agree it's acceptable. 

Unfortunately you can't just say "Surely it is..." ðŸ˜”. 

### How do you do it?
1. Write a claim
2. Declare the type of proof you're writing
3. Write out the rest of the layout 
4. Do the actual work of your proof
5. Write out the conclusion

There's multiple proofs we will go through #dmp:
- [[Proofs by Contradiction]]
- [[Direct Proofs]]
- [[Proof by Contraposition]]
- [[Constructive Proof Of Existence]]
- [[Non Constructive Proof Of Existence]]
- [[Disproof By Counter Example]]
- [[Proof by Induction]]
