### Converting Probability, $P$, to Odds, $O$:
Plug your probability into the following formula. 
$$O = \frac{P}{1 - P}$$
The result you get (imagine plugging in $P=0.75$ and getting $O=3$), is the odds of it happening. Therefore, the odds of that event would be ***3 to 1*** (three times more likely to occur).

### Converting Odds to Log Odds:
Often we want to be able to express odds as a single number. To do that, simply take $ln(O)$. To convert it back, take $e^{ln(O)}$ to get $O$ (simple power arithmetic).
