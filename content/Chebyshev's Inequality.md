### What is it?
It's actually quite a neat rule. The rule states, for any $k \geq 1$, $(1-\frac{1}{k^2})\%$ of the data lies $k$ standard deviations away from the mean. This is not specific to any shape of distribution. Some [[Probability Distributions - PMF vs PDF vs CDF vs More|probability distributions]] have more specific formulae to get even tighter bounding.
