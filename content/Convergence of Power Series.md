### Theorem
Consider the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n(x-a)^n$. The series satisfies exactly one of the following properties:

i. The series converges at $x = a$ and diverges for all $x \neq a$.
ii. The series converges for all real numbers $x$.
iii. There exists a real number $R > 0$ such that the series converges if $|x - a| < R$ and diverges if $|x - a| > R$. At the values $x$ where $|x - a| = R$, the series may converge or diverge.
