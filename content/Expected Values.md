Using [[Probability]], calculating the expected amount you'd gain based on probability. 
### Example:
Imagine a raffle where you have a $\frac{1}{1000}$ chance of winning a $\$500$. You get each raffle ticket for free. Each raffle ticket would expect to win you $\$0.50$ ($\frac{1}{1000} \times \$500 + \frac{999}{1000} \times 0$). 
### Linearity of Expectation:
Simply says the following: $$E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y)$$
