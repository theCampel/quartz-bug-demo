### What:
Sometime's you may get a function in the form $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^3}$ and want it in a [[Power Series]] representation. 

### How to convert Function to Power Series:
Remember, by definition of the sum of an [[Sequences|infinite sequence]], a series: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}ar^n = a + ar + ar^{2 + \ldots}= \frac{a}{1-r}$$
when $|r|\lt 1$. Use this fact to manipulate a function into the RHS of above. You can then extract $a$ and $r$ and put them in the form of the LHS.

From here, you can pretty easily find the [[Radius of Convergence]].
