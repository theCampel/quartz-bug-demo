### Concept:
What if you're only interested in the last few bits of a [[Binary]] address? How can you extract that?

### Steps:
1. Your Address: `0x12345678` (In binary: `0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000`)
2. Your Mask: `0x0000000F` (In binary: `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111`)
3. Apply Mask: Perform a bitwise AND between the address and the mask.
   - Result: `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000`
