## IP Vulnerabilities
When it comes to IPs, there's lots of problems:
- ***No Source Authentication***
	- Sender that says *"I'm `x`, here's `y`"* could be an absolute lie lol.
- ***No Integrity Checking***
	- All packets can be modified. Again, [[ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)|Man in the Middle]] attack applies here. 
- ***No bandwidth constraints***
	- Denial of Service accounts because a source could flood all of that.  


### Some Network Attack Types include:
- DDOS
- Wiretapping / Sniffing
- Spoofing
- Tampering
