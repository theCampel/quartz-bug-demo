### Centres of Gravity / Mass on a Line:
> [!Definition] Centre of Gravity / Mass
> It's the point on a line (or plane), for most intents and purposes, where all the weight ***may as well be located***. It would have the same moment as the current weights in their current location. 
> The formula is as follows:
> For masses $m_1,m_2,...,m_n$ located at $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$:
> $$
>\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\limits{m_{i}}{x_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}}
>$$
>Basically, ***sum up all the moments and divide them by all the masses***.

### Centres of Gravity / Mass on a Plane:
Ok. So you can successfully and easily get the COGs of a line. What about a plane? Well what is a plane if nothing but 2 dimensional lines... No seriously. The formula for getting the the $\bar{x},\bar{y}$ coordinates is literally the same as the individual line.

Now just wait until you have to get the [[Centre of Mass of a Uniform Plane Lamina]]
