### What:
A type of [[Algorithms]]. It's built off small, consecutive steps. Each decision is made for what's the best thing you can do at that small, local step. Ideally, it ends being the globally best solution. 

### Examples:
- [[Interval Scheduling]]
- [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]
- A specific sub-example of Greedy Algorithms: [[Greedy Approximation Algorithms]]
