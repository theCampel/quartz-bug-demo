### Implication

There’s the bog standard [[Logical Connectives]] you’re already used to; _and_, _or_, _not_ etc. There is a new one to consider: _**Implies**_. The symbol is _**A → B**_ , read as “_A implies B”_

Consider the statement: “_If you study hard, then you will pass the test_”. Studying hard will be **A** and passing the test will be **B**. The truth table _for the statement as a whole_ is to the right.

If **A** is false, then we can’t really deduce anything about the actual statement. The statement tells us nothing about what actually happens if we _don’t_ study. Thus, the statement could still hold True. Therefore, if **A** is ever False, the implicative is True.
