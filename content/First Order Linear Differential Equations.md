Yehhh... I know it sounds quite hard, but it's really not that complicated. They're equations that come in the form:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)
$$

To solve this, you'll need an "integrating factor". Firstly, the integrating factor is $\mu (x)=e^{\int{p(x)dx}}$. We do this because we're next going to multiply everything by it, so we end up with the LHS in the form:
$$
\mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x)p(x)y
$$
Note: This looks a lot like the expansion of the product rule (Derivative = $f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$). Thus, you can turn the LHS into $\mu(x)y$.
