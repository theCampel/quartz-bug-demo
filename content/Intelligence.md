What is intelligence? Is it a uniquely human characteristic? What happens when [[AI]] can perform as many tasks on the internet as a collection of experts could? Is that machine now intelligent? Where does that leave humans?

The human brain is a computer. It has 100 trillion neurons, with 100 trillion connections in between them. This is a hard concrete number. This is theoretically surpassable (relatively soon as well due to the [[Compound Effect]] of [[Technology]]). What happens when a [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]] reaches a comparable parameter count?

> When [[AI]] becomes so capable, who will care if it's intelligent or not? So what it may not have feelings or whatever. 

### How do we quantify it?
Alan Turing famously came up with the [[Turing Test]]. It's significantly outdated. But I like the more modern take ([[Turing Test|Modern Turing Test]]).
