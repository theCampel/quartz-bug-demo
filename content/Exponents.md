A fundamental concept in [[Calculus]]. 

When dealing with exponents, smart people defined the number $e$.

> The slope of the function $e^t$ at any point $t$ is $e$. 

Consider the function $a^t$. An alternative (and often preferable) way of writing that is $e^{ct}$, where $c$ is $ln(a)$. 

### Formula for Exponents:
> [!Note] Formula:
> 
> $$P(t) = P_{0}e^{kt}$$
> Where:
> - $P(t)$ is the value at *time* $t$, 
> - $P_0$ is the *initial starting value*, 
> - $k$ is the *growth constant*. 
> 
> If the growth constant is $ln(a)$, then the function is multiplying by $a$ each iteration. For example, if it's $ln(2)$, the function is constantly doubling. 


Also a note:
> [!tip] Note
> When a variable's [[rate of change]] is directly proportional to itself, the variable is an exponential.
