### Ways Representing Data:
- [[(Computer) Bit]]
- [[Binary|Representing Numbers and Data as Binary]]
- [[Hexadecimal Notation]]

### Data Types:
Hardware has a few different (fixed size) data-types. When trying to squash a larger data-type into smaller one, it creates [[Data Overflow]]. 

### Operating on Data Types:
- [[Shifting]]


### Converting Data Types to larger types:
Also kinda easy. If you're converting a number in English from 024 to 6 digits, you'd add a 0 3 more times. It's exactly the same as converting a [[Byte]] to a [[Short]]. Whatever sign the [[2s Complement Representation]] has, just repeatedly extend that sign to fill up the new space. EG:
