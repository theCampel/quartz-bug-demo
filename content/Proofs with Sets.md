One of the basic ways of doing a proof with sets is the Element Argument. What is it?

### Element Argument: Proof subset-ness
Let sets $X$ and $Y$ be a given. To prove $X \subseteq Y$:
1. Suppose $x$ is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of $X$,
2. Show that $x$ is an element of $Y$

### Proving Sets are Equal:
Basic way of proving sets are equal:
- Prove $X \subseteq Y$
- Prove $Y \subseteq X$
