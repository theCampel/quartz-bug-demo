The `p`-th percentile of a distribution marks the point such that `p`% of the values are below it. 

### Example:

Let's say $n_p$ is $7.9$. The value corresponds to about 0.3. Thus, the shaded area is 0.3 of the entire distribution. Thus, $n_p$ is in the 30th percentile ([[Percentiles of a Distribution]]) of the distribution.
