### Definition
A set is a collection of items. Order and occurrence does not matter. You can use set builder notation like:

$[x| x < 10\ \ and\ \ x \in{N}]$
OR
$\{x \in S\ |\ P(x)\}$ -> Read as *"The set of all S such that P(x)"*

Sets also have distinct [[Set Properties & Laws]].



### Complement of a set:
$A^c$ or $Ä€$.

### Cartesian Product:
The set of all pairs of two sets. EG $A(1,2,3) \times B(a,b) = \{{(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b),(3,a),(3,b)}\}$.
### Set Equality:
$A = B \iff A \subseteq B\ and\ B \subseteq A$
### Proper Subset:
A subset of a set bar the set itself. I don't know how that's particularly useful but there you go. Figure is: $\subset$
### Power Set:
The power set of a set is a set with all the possible subsets of the original set. The size is $2^n$, where $n$ is the original size of the set. 
### Disjointed Sets:
Sets A and B are disjointed iff they share no elements in common. ($A \cap B = \varnothing$)
*Mutually Disjoint Sets* often refers to multiple sets (A, B, C) with no similarities amongst them. 
### Partition of Sets:
A set of subsets of A, where no subset overlaps (I.E. they're all Mutually Disjointed Sets).

A related concept in Set Theory.
