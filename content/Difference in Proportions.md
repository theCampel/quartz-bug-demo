### What?
In [[A-B Testing]], we often want to compare different success rates between two different groups. The formula for getting the standard error of proportions is very tightly linked with [[Standard Error]] in general. 


The formula for ***standard error in proportions*** is: $$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$$
We can use this to say "*We're X% confident that the true difference between the two proportions falls between that range*".
