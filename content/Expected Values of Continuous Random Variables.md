*Similar* to [[Expected Values]], this is the average value get from randomly plucking a value x that has a probability of PDF(x) of getting plucked a bunch of times. It's calculated by integrating the product of the variables values and its $PDF$ over all possible values. You integrate because the values you're plucking are continuous. You 

##### Formula:
$E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x \cdot PDF(x)\ dx$
