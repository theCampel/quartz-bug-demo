> [!note] Even Functions
> ***Even Functions*** are functions that are symmetric about the ***y axis***. They're called this because all exponential functions with an even power follow this rule. ($x^2,x^4,x^6$). Mathematically:
> $$f(-x)=f(x)$$

Contrastingly:
> [!note] Odd Functions
> ***Odd Functions*** are functions that are symmetric about the ***origin***. Exponential functions with an odd power follow this rule ($x^3, x^5, x^7$). 
> $$f(-x)=-f(x)$$
