When looking at a [[Probability Distributions - PMF vs PDF vs CDF vs More|probability distribution]], we can get lots of great information from them. Some important things to get:

- [[Percentiles of a Distribution]]
- [[Median of Continuous Distribution]]
- [[Expected Values of Continuous Random Variables]]
- [[Expected Value of a Function of a Continuous Random Variable]]
- [[Rescaling Expectation, Variance and Std]]
