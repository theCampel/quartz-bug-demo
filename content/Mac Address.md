## What
48-[[(Computer) Bit|bit]] number, used to uniquely identify devices. 

### How to convert from binary:
- A single digit represents `4 bits`. ($2^{4} = 16\ \text{possibilities} = 16^1$)
- There's 12 digits.
- You do the [[Maths]] lol.

### Network Interfaces:
Anything with a network interface comes with a predefined MAC address. This is to uniquely identify it within the network. Fun fact, the first 3 octets are manufacturer specific:
	- Cisco is `00-1A-A1`
	- Apple is `00-0a-95`
