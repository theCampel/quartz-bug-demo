### Definition:
When data exceeds the space allotted for it, spills into the storage ([[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|memory]], [[OS Memory Management (x86)|memory in x86]]) for something else and causes something unexpected to happen. Can cause corruption, data loss and vulnerabilities (E.G. [[Buffer Overflow Attack]]).
