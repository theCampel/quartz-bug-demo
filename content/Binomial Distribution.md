### What:
In short, it describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials. Imagine flipping a coin (p=0.5) 5 times (n=5). The chances of getting all failures or all successes would fall onto one side of the distribution.  
The Binomial (Normal) Distribution is an incredibly popular one, characterised by it's unique bell-shaped curve (hence another name for it: Bell-Curve).

Where n is the number of trials with a success probability p, x is the number of successes of X.
