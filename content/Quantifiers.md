These are:
- Universal Quantifier -> "For all" -> $\forall$
- Existential Quantifier -> "For some", "For at least one", "there is", -> $\exists$
	- $\exists !$ is the uniqueness quantifier -> "There exists one and only one"
- "Many"
- "None"

The first two have the highest precedence.

If a variable has a quantifier, then it is **bound**. Variables in a proposition must have a bound for it to qualify as a proposition.
