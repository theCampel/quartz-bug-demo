The exam allows us to bring in 3 A4 pages. In them, there will be:
- ***[[Riemann Sums]]***
	- Definition
	- Area under curve
	- Left and Right

- Limit Laws
- Obviously all calculus laws
	- [[Integrals]] and Differentiations
		- Plus reminder to include ends when doing u-sub with definite integrals
	- Including Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
	- Chain Rule: 
		- $\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))\times g'(x)$
	- integral of ln(x)
	- 

- Trig [[functions]], their equalities etc.
- Complex Trig functions and their simpler equivalent.
- Random ass equalities, eg. lim(sin(x)/x) = 1
	- lim(Sin(3x)/x)=3
	- lim(sin(x)/3x)=1/3
	- lim(x^2 * sin(1/x)) as x->0 = 
	- Sigma Laws and useful facts to memorise
	- integral of sqrt(1+tan^2(x))
	- sin(x) < x for x > 0.
		- $\int e^x \cos(x) \, dx$
		- Solution -> $\frac{e^x \sin(x)}{2} + \frac{e^x \cos(x)}{2} + C$ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		- $\int \frac{f'(y)}{f(y)} dy = \ln |f(y)|$
		- 
- Common Convergent stuff like "we know that 1/t converges" etc.
- Convergence, [[integral test]]
- [[Alternating Series Test]]
- [[Ratio Test]]
- [[Convergence of Power Series]]



- Logs
- All of ln()'s to be handy for instant [[logarithmic differentiation]]
- Formula for Washer, include outer=f(x) and inner=g(x)
- Formula for Arc Length
- All the Physics formulae
	- Think of all the stuff done in the Work Module Week 6
	- Center of Mass
- Completing the Square
- Integrating Discontinuous integrals
- For convergence: P - test![[Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 4.02.20 p.m..png]]
- Sec^2 identity
- Logistic Differential Equation
- First Order Linear Differential Equation**** (FOLDE)
- Something that tells me to add a damn C
- Solids of Revolutions
- Better Mathematics?
- Definition of critical points
- [[Linear Approximation]]
- Basic Geometry stuff - area of sphere etc.
	- Also basic physics stuff - Density, Weight, mass, moments[[Moments and Centres of Gravity - Mass|moments]] etc.
- Half-life question - Week 6 Workshop
- Same for DiffEquation*** + How to solve (ie. either separable equations or FOLDE)
- Partial Fractions -> + Partial Sums (week 9 workshop)
- Decimal Expansion (week 9 workshop)
- P Tests of funky fractions
- How power series are related to geometric series.
