It's the moving of [[Binary]] of a data type left or right. It actually corresponds to multiplication and division of the binary number:

### Left Shifts:
- Fill in missing space with 0's. 
- *6 shifted two to the left is 24*. Represented as: $00000110 << 2 \rightarrow 00011000$ 
- Shift left by $n \equiv$ multiplying by $2^n$

### Right Shifts:
Options:
1. **Logical Shift**: Fill space with 0's (for non-numerical data). 
2. **Arithmetic Shift**: Fill with MSB (for 2's complement numbers).
