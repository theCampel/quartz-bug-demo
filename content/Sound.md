## What:
Sound, in [[Physics]] is a ***[[Wave]]***. Waves, remember, have certain properties:
- Frequency - refers to pitch
- Amplitude - volume / loudness


## Representing Sound:
#### As a Waveform:

- Imagine that's a 10 second clip of me speaking. `x-axis` refers to a given point of time.
- `y-axis` refers to amplitude of wave at that point in time.
- Frequency is amount of peaks in a given point of time.
- This is referred to as ***analog sound***.
- Also fairly easy to normalise from this. 

#### As Spectrogram:
- Colour (`dBFS` - decibels relative to full scale)
- Darker spots are typically silence. 
- Every word is split up into [[Phonemes]], which each have their own frequency patterns.

### Measuring it:
When measuring digital sound, we split it into *"samples"*. This is simply a measurement of the audio's [[Wave|amplitude]] at that point in time.
