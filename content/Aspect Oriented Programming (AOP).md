## What
It's a design approach for programming *stuff* that ***span across** applications*, but aren't crucial for running the application itself. This includes *logging* and *security*. This means those parts can be modularised and keeps code clean.

I prefer to use [[Object Orientated Programming (OOP)|OOP]] but that's just me.
