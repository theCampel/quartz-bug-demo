### Rescaling of Expectation, Variance, and Standard Deviation
When a random variable $X$ is rescaled by a constant $a$, where $Y = aX + b$, the *expectation*, *variance*, and *standard deviation* are affected as follows:
- The expectation becomes $E(Y) = aE(X) + b$
- The variance becomes $\text{Var}(Y) = a^2 \text{Var}(X)$.
- The standard deviation, being the square root of the variance, is scaled by the absolute value of $a:\   \text{SD}(Y) = |a| \text{SD}(X)$.
