### What?
Statistical functions used to estimate a [[Parameters of a Distribution|population parameter]] based on sample data. 

### Keep in Mind:
- ***Bias***: An estimator is unbiased if the expected value of the estimation is equal to the true value of the population parameter. 
	- $\text{bias} = E[\hat{\theta} - \theta] = E[\hat{\theta}] - \theta$
- ***Consistency***: A consistent estimator gives you increasingly accurate estimates of the population parameter as the sample size grows

### What about the variance (Mean Squared Error) of it?
Typical variance definition. Ideally, your estimator varies vary little. 
- $\text{MSE} = E[(\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2]$
