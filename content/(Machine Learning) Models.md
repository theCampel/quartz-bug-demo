> When referring to any sort of [[AI]] Models, we must ask ourselves; '*What are models?*':

> *They're unique abstractions of reality, which we can form any way we choose.* 

### Jargon ('Shargough' according to lecturer lol) 
- Quantities we *want to predict* are called: *dependent*, *response* or *target variables*. (Often denoted *y*)
- Quantities we *use for prediction* are called: *independent / exploratory variables*, *covariates* or *features*. (Often denoted *x*)
- *Parametric Model*: A model with some free-moving variables that we can *fit* so the model becomes better (E.G. Weights in a [[Neural Network]]) - Done by optimising a loss function. 


### Numerical Diagnostics:
The following formulae are used to assess fits of models. 
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Note: squares units as well)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$) (R Squared)
