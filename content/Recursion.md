A common theme that comes up in [[INF2 - Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures (IADS)|iADS]], [[Efficiency in Algorithms|efficiency]] and [[Data Structures]] and [[Divide and Conquer Algorithms]]. 
### Basically:
Involving a sub-call to smaller instances of the same problem.  
##### For *before, during and after* a recursive call:
*Divide* the problem into smaller bits, *conquer* (solve) the smaller problems, *combine* them back into a cohesive solution.
