It's a pretty dumb theorem stating the obvious... As per.

Informally, if a continuous differentiable function starts and ends at the same $y$ over a given range, then there's at least one critical point.

> [!note] Rolle's Theorem
> If:
> - Differentiable on a range
> - Starts and ends at the same $y$ (I.E. $f(a)=f(b)$)
> - $\therefore$ There must be a $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$ (I.E. It's a extrema...)

### Further Applications:
With this, we're able to generalise more freely to The [[Mean Value Theorem]].
