### How to be Productive?
- ***Just Start:*** Don't paralyse yourself by trying to globally optimise everything. Just start. You're better off doing something sub-optimally then staying at the beginning *(which is technically optimal lol).* 

- ***Experiment Ruthlessly, Endlessly:*** Everyone works differently. This also ties into [[Productivity|learning]]. Experiment with every potential variable. Track the results.
	- Try more/less hours of sleep.
	- Try caffeine / no breakfast / breakfast.
	- Try different notetaking methods. Try handwritten or digital.
	- Try learning by building. Try learning by watching lectures only. Try not watching lectures at all. 
	- I found I learn best with good sleep, trying to teaching others and spaced repetition, but you could be different. Never stop experimenting with new methods as well!

- ***Take Care of Yourself:*** Drink lots of water. Exercise. 

- ***Snowball your efforts:*** Work on something really hard for a long period of time. Do it for long enough, and the effects will make you immeasurably better. Ties into [[Compound Effect]].
