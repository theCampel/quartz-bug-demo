title: Hey! I'm Leo üëã
---
I'm a 3rd year [[Computer Science|Computer Science]] student at the [[University of Edinburgh|University of Edinburgh]]. Welcome to my corner of the internet! 

### About Me:
- I ***co-founded*** [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]'s [[AI]] Society, [[EdinburghAI]], where I'm currently ***President***.
- I'm an active member of [[EUFS|EUFS üèéÔ∏è]], a society that builds [[Autonomous Vehicles|self-driving]] race cars from scratch. I'm currently trying to use [[AI|Machine Learning]] to optimise the global path around the race track. 
- This past summer, I interned at ***[JPMorganChase](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/global/en/students/programs/software-engineer-summer)*** as a [[Computer Science|software engineer]]! 

> [!question] What is this website?
> It's a blend of my [[Computer Science|University notes]], [[Personal Projects|personal projects]] and [[Essays|written essays]]! You can search for a given topic using the üîç icon at the top (eg. *"Memory Hierarchy"*). Alternatively, you can just click around (eg. [[Power Series]])!

    <h3>Where I've Worked:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Summer 2023, I interned at <a href="https://careers.jpmorgan.com/global/en/students/programs/software-engineer-summer" target="_blank">J.P. MorganChase</a> as a software engineer. I learned how to build at scale with AWS.</li>
      <li>I interned at <a href="https://itus-tech.com/" target="_blank">ITUS Secure Technologies</a>, a Cybersecurity startup that aided the recovery of cybercrime victims, as well as general security managed services.</li>
      <li>I spent a research internship at <a href="https://www.neuroconcise.co.uk/" target="_blank">NeuroConcise</a>. We developed a discreet EEG that allowed Locked-In patients to communicate with previously incommunicable patients.</li>
    </ul>

> [!example] I was the target audience...
> I write my notes so that ***I*** can come back and re-learn the concepts easily. They're messy, scrappy and incomplete. That's the learning process at the end of the day üòâ.
> 
> Also, some hyperlinks may not work - they're likely private notes (eg. [[Spirals|Spirals in Life]])
