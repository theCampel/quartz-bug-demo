## What:
It's not just coding. When you're doing it, split it up into multiple bits.

### 1. Requirements Capture
##### Process:
- Identify *what* the software must do. 
	- ***Functional Requirements***: What the system should do
	- ***Non-Functional Requirements***: *How it should be*: How fast it should be, show seldom it should fail etc. (Informally called 'ilities' - efficiency, security, portability etc.) 
##### Where to get Requirements:[]()
- Goals
- Stakeholders
- Business Rules - I.E. The uni may not allow you to do certain things with your code

Ensure your requirements are verifiable, possible (given time / money budget) etc. 
## 2. Designing
Think of the following:
- *Requirements*: **What** must the software do. ***Incredibly Important***
- *Design*: **How** should it do that
	- High level - UML

## 3. Construction
- Coding
- Testing
- Documentation

## 4. Maintenance
- Stopping Software Rot
- Coping in an evolving world

> [!note] Interesting Note:
> TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of a system often dwarfs dev costs.
