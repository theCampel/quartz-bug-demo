We've already internalised the idea of [[Limits]]. They're pretty obvious; "What does the value of a function equal when the input of that function gets *super* close to another arbitrary value *a*."


Continuity is another quite simple idea. Basically, that a line (or output of a function), along a given range, is unbroken.

> Essentially, a function has an output $L$ at a given point, and when you approach it from either side, it looks like the limit is that same $L$.
