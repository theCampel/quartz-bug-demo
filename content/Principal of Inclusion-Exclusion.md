### First, Cardinality:
The amount of items in a set. 

### Principal of Inclusion-Exclusion:
Also: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$ -> Cos you'd otherwise be counting their overlap twice instead of once. 
Note: $|A \cap B|$ could be $\varnothing$ if A and B are [[Set Theory|mutually disjoint]]. 
What about for sets $A$, $B$, $C$ ?
Same idea: $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$
