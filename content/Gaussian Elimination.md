A matrix is in ***Row Echelon Form*** when it’s in it’s “nice form”. There’s 3 rules:

1. All $0$’s are at the bottom.  
2. There is a leading $1$ in each row. 
3. Each following *leading* $1$ is to the right of the one above it.

It is ***Reduced*** when each *leading* $1$ is the only one in it’s column. 

It will look like a staircase. 

ILA Math Notes has examples of bringing Matrices down to their (reduced) REF. 

Just know the following:

> The *Reduced* REF of Matrix A is directly influenced by the original Matrix A. Whereas if you just bring Matrix A to boring REF, the same original Matrix A could have multiple different REF.
> 

The ***Rank*** is the number of leading 1’s.
