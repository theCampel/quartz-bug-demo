## Imagine:
- All hard problems can essentially be boiled down to [[Functions|functions]] [[Computability|(well almost all of them)]]. These could be:
	- $f(x)=y$
	- $f(\text{historical stocks data})=\text{Tomorrow's stock price}$
	- $f(\text{image of a dog})=\text{the breed}$
	- $f(\text{the current position of a car, and all of it's surroundings})=\text{the movement the wheels should take}$
- By training a [[Neural Network]], we're simply undergoing a process to find the specific function. For the first one it could be easy. But for the others? How do we do it?
