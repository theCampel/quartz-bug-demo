### The Concept:
Normally, when calculating the **area** (*2-dimensional*) under a curve, we take thin, rectangular slices, get each's specific **height** (*1-dimensional*) with $f(x)$, then add them all up (using *integration*).

But (one of) the beautiful thing(s) about [[Calculus]]? It's not limited to *2 dimensions*. If I wanted to calculate the **volume** of a **shape** (*3-dimensional*), I'd follow the exact same method. I'd cut the shape (*3D*) into **thin planes** (2D), get each of their areas (2D again), then add all those up with *integration again*. 

The only thing extra step is you have to work on getting a formula for the area of the **plane** at any point x (as opposed to the typical area of a function). It's really quite a neat discovery.
