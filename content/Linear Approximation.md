### What:
In [[Calculus]], when something is hard to calculate, we may try to get an approximation. The general form is as follows: $f(x) \approx L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)$

### Example:
Take $\sqrt{9.2}$ -> using $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and $f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$ and $a=9$. Thus $\sqrt{9.2} \approx 3 + \frac{1}{6} \cdot 0.2 = 3.033\ldots$
