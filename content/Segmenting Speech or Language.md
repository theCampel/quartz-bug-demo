### What's it all about?
When talking about [[Language|spoken language]], consider how we differentiate the non-stop sound waves hitting our ears into concrete words? 

### Methods:
- In English, we tend to stress the first syllable - this can give a clue it's a new word. (*hamster* vs *ham stir*)
- In English we have rules about how every word must contain a vowel, finite set of consonant clusters at the beginning of a word, etc. (EG. *gd*og isn't a word) 
- We can also bootstrap from words we already know
- Within words, there's phonemes that occur consistently - we use [[Statistical Regularities in Speech]].
