Basically all of [[(Machine Learning) Models]] nowadays are behemoths of engineering challenges. 

NVidia's GPU's have NVLink -> which allows extremely high throughput for GPU-GPU communication at training time over the network.  

There's different ways to parallelise DNN training:
- [[Data Parallelism]]
- [[Model Parrallelism]]
