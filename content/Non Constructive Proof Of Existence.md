Closely related to [[Constructive Proof Of Existence]], but this doesn't actually involve finding the digits about it. 

This involves one of the following:
- Showing that the existence of a given digit, that *would* prove a statement, exists thanks to a different theorem or axiom
- Showing, with [[Proofs by Contradiction]], that the assumption that that digit doesn't exist would lead to a contradiction.

This type of proof can be a balls when you're trying to actually find out how to get those digits.
